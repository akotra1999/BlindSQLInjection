# BlindSQLInjection

BlindSQLInjectionScript.py is a Python script that performs a blind SQL injection on a website I created. The code for the website can be found in [another repo of mine](https://github.com/akotra1999/BasicSQLInjection). The relevant files are webapp.js and index.html. The Python script I wrote retrieves usernames and passwords from the website. 

A demo of the script can be found [here](https://youtu.be/X5A3ILtbkDs)!

I used code and concepts from the following resources to create my own blind SQL injection script. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNHn38EyRc), [website](https://defendtheweb.net/article/blind-sql-injection), and [article](https://lakshmi993.medium.com/blind-sql-injection-mysql-data-base-d2f35afbc451) all show how to perform a SQL injection attack. This [response on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38588880) shows how to send post requests in Python.
